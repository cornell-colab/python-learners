# Python learners group (Fall 2022)
Instructors: Iliana Burgos (itb23) and Devin Sanera (ds895)

## Session time and location

Olin Library Room 703

Fridays, 3-4pm:
* September 16, session one: anatomy of a Python script and common errors
* September 23, session two: variables, data types, and string methods
* September 30, session three: comparisons and conditionals
* October 7, session four: lists and loops

Our current plan is to meet once a week for four weeks. After that, depending on interest, we can continue with more advanced programming topics. 

**We don't expect you to do any work outside of session time unless you'd like to.** We can help provide resources and external lessons that speak to your personal goals for learning Python.

Each session will have this (approximate!) structure:
* 10 minutes: Settle in, check in with one another. Devin and Iliana introduce the lesson for the day.
* 40 minutes: Everyone works on the designated lesson content for the day, or a separate Python lesson geared towards their personal interests. Questions are welcome!
* 10 minutes: We share out any joys, frustrations, questions and comments about the day's studies.

## Resources

### Main textbook

[_Introduction to Cultural Analytics & Python, Version 1 _(Walsh, 2021)](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/welcome.html)

### Additional resources of interest

We'll add to this list throughout the next few weeks, according to the group's interests.

#### For the library staff in the room

## What's the Python learners group?
The Python learners group is intended for learners that are very new to programming. We'll work through lessons on the fundamentals of Python using [_Introduction to Cultural Analytics & Python, Version 1 _(Walsh, 2021)](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/welcome.html) as our core text.

The primary goal of this series is for you to learn Python and programming at your own pace with help from a supportive community of learners. While Devin and I have plans for what the group can cover week to week, we invite you to share what your personal learning goals are, too. We are happy to adjust plans along the way and point you to relevant resources for your interests.

## Support outside of our group meetup time

Devin and Iliana will be available at the CoLab during the following times if you'd like to troubleshoot in-person:
* Fridays, 1-3pm during the regular [CoLab Co-working hours](https://digitalscholarship.library.cornell.edu/coworking), Olin Library Room 701

If that time does not work for you, feel free to message us to schedule a separate meeting time.
