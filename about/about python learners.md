## What's the Python learners?
The Python learners group is intended for learners that are very new to programming. We'll work through 

primarily a study group: we have a We realize that each of you will have your own personal interests and goals in using and applying your knowledge in Python.

Our current plan is to meet once a week for four weeks, with some work on your own in between. After that, depending on interest, we can continue with more advanced programming topics.
