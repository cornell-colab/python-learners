## Session time and location

*updated!*: Olin Library Room 701

**Fridays, 3-4pm:**
* Session zero: Installing Python and computer questions 
* Session one: Variables, data types and loops
* Session two: 

Our current plan is to meet once a week for three weeks. After that, depending on interest, we can continue with more advanced programming topics. 

Each session will have this (approximate!) structure:
* **10 minutes:** Settle in, check in with one another. Devin and Iliana introduce the lesson topic for the day.
* **40 minutes:** Everyone works on the designated lesson content for the day, or a separate Python lesson geared towards their personal interests. Questions are welcome!
* **10 minutes:** We share out any joys, frustrations, questions and comments about the day's studies.

## Resources

### Main textbook

[Introduction to Cultural Analytics & Python, Version 1 (Walsh, 2021)](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/welcome.html)

### Additional resources of interest

We'll add to this list throughout the next few weeks, according to the group's interests.

* [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
* [W2Schools Online Web Tutorials](https://docs.python.org/3/)
* [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org)

#### For the library staff in the room

* [Python for Librarians (Library Carpentry)](https://librarycarpentry.org/library-python/)
* [Python lessons for librarians (Janowiecki, 2021)](https://gitlab.com/mjanowiecki/python-lessons-for-librarians/-/wikis/home)

## What's the Python learners group?
The Python learners group is intended for learners that are very new to programming. We'll work through lessons on the fundamentals of Python using [Introduction to Cultural Analytics & Python, Version 1 (Walsh, 2021)](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/welcome.html) as our core text.

The primary goal of this series is for you to learn Python and programming at your own pace with help from a supportive community of learners. While Devin and Iliana have plans for what the group can cover week to week, we invite you to share your own learning goals, too. We are happy to adjust plans along the way and point you to relevant resources for your interests.

## Support outside of our group meetup time

Devin and Iliana will be available weekly at the CoLab if you'd like to troubleshoot in-person:
* Fridays, 1-3pm during the regular [CoLab Co-working hours](https://digitalscholarship.library.cornell.edu/coworking), Olin Library Room 701

If that time does not work for you, feel free to message us to schedule a separate meeting time.
