# Session 4

Instructors:
* Iliana Burgos, Emerging Data Practices Librarian (itb23)
* Devin Sanera, Instructional Technology Coordinator (ds895)

## Welcome, review of previous session, and questions (10 minutes)

* Any questions from last time?
* Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs

## Opening a file and importing data (10 minutes)

## for() loops (10 minutes)
* There are many ways to use a for() loop, one of the most powerful ways is to interate through a list.
* In part of the set-up, you decide what to name the variable that will hold each list element for each single run of the loop.
* In this example, "number" is not a variable used elsewhere, we are defining it right here. "number" will take on the values 1, 2, 3, 4 in sequence for each run of the loop. The result of this output is the sequence 2, 3, 4, 5.

```
list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
for number in list:
  print(number + 1)
```

## Evaluating data with comparisons, conditionals, and loops (15 minutes)


## Conclusion, discuss questions, and lessons learned (10 minutes)

* Think about how you could use conditionals and comparisons to evaluate, sort, or clean data from a list.

**Share out either of the following:**
* One interesting thing you learned
* One question you have
* Any concerns or unclear topics?
