# Introduction to Python 
Instructors: Iliana Burgos (itb23) and Devin Sanera (ds895)

## Before the session
The pre-work for this session contains two parts: installing Python and Jupyter Lab onto your computer, and moving through a few lessons to learn some Python basics. Get as far as you can, and reach out if you have any issues along the way. 

Devin and Iliana will be available at the CoLab during the following time if you'd like to troubleshoot in-person:
* Tuesday, June 14, 2-3pm

If that time does not work for you, feel free to message Devin to schedule a time for support.
