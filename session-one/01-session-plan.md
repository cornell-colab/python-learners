### Installing Python and Jupyter Lab

* [Install Python and Jupyter Lab](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/02-Python/01-Install-Python.html)
  * Make sure to install the variable inspector!
* [How to Use Jupyter Notebooks](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/02-Python/02-How-to-Use-Jupyter-Notebooks.html)
