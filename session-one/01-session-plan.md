* Devin Sanera, Instructional Technology Coordinator (ds895)

## Welcome, settle in (5 minutes)

Review [logistics for the Python learners group](https://github.com/cornell-colab/python-learners/blob/main/home/about%20the%20group.md)

## Group introductions (10 minutes)

* Your name, preferred pronouns (if you'd like to share)
* Your degree program
* Your goals for learning Python (1-2 sentences) 

## Choose your own Python adventure (35 minutes)

### Choice A: installing Python and Jupyter Lab
<u>Intended for folks that:</u>
* Would like to install and set up Anaconda and Jupyter Lab


#### Installing Python and Jupyter Lab
Follow instructions from [<i>Introduction to Cultural Analytics & Python</i> (Walsh, 2021)](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/welcome.html) to download Anaconda and Jupyter Lab onto your computer, and learn about Jupyter Notebooks:
* [Install Python and Jupyter Lab](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/02-Python/01-Install-Python.html)
  * Make sure to install the variable inspector!
* [How to Use Jupyter Notebooks](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/02-Python/02-How-to-Use-Jupyter-Notebooks.html)

#### Optional: The Command Line

If you'd like to move beyond installing Python, check out [the Command Line](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/01-Command-Line/01-The-Command-Line.html) lesson. It provides a helpful foundation for learning how to communicate with your computer to open programs, access files, and consider file directories. This is especially important for learning how to access data files for analysis using Python.

However, if you're eager to jump into Python scripts, you can skim or skip this section.

### Choice B: Anatomy of a Python script and common errors

<u>Intended for folks that:</u>
* Already completed Choice A, or
* Want to understand the different parts of creating and running a Python script

#### [Anatomy of a Python script](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/02-Python/03-Anatomy-Python-Script.html)
This section discusses the building blocks that make a Python script. 

#### [Common errors](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/02-Python/13-Common-Python-Errors.html)
Learn about a few common error messages in Python and how to start troubleshooting when you encounter them.

### Choice C: Python variables and data types

<u>Intended for folks that:</u>
* Already feel comfortable with the topics in A and B, or
* Want more hands-on examples

#### [Python variables](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/02-Python/04-Variables.html)
Learn how to assign variables in your Python script. 

#### [Python data types](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/02-Python/04-Variables.html)
Learn how to work with different data types.
