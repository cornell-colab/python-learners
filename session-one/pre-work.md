### Installing Python and Jupyter Lab
Follow instructions from [<i>Introduction to Cultural Analytics & Python</i> (Walsh, 2021)](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/welcome.html) to download Jupyter Lab onto your computer and learn about Jupyter Notebooks:
* [Install Python and Jupyter Lab](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/02-Python/01-Install-Python.html)
  * Make sure to install the variable inspector!
* [How to Use Jupyter Notebooks](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/02-Python/02-How-to-Use-Jupyter-Notebooks.html)

### Optional: The Command Line

If you'd like to move beyond installing Python, check out [the Command Line](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/01-Command-Line/01-The-Command-Line.html) lesson. It provides a helpful foundation for learning how to communicate with your computer to open programs, access files, and consider file directories. This is especially important for learning how to access data files for analysis using Python.

However, if you're eager to jump into Python scripts, you can skim or skip this section.
