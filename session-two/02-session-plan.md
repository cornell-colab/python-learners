# Session 2
Instructors:
* Iliana Burgos, Emerging Data Practices Librarian (itb23)
* Devin Sanera, Instructional Technology Coordinator (ds895)

## Welcome, review of previous session, and questions (15 minutes)

* Any questions from last time?
* Differences between VisualStudio, PyCharm, JupyterLab, VSCode
  * Differences between an IDE vs text editor, how the computer is processing your code
* Brief review of [Anatomy of a Python script](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/02-Python/03-Anatomy-Python-Script.html) and [Common Python errors](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/02-Python/13-Common-Python-Errors.html)

## Variables and Data Types (35 minutes)

* Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs
  * Today we will learn about the data side of this formula

### [Python variables](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/02-Python/04-Variables.html)
* A variable is a "container" for data. In Python, we create a new variable by assigning a value to it (other languages differ). If you've used a spreadsheet to run calculations, each cell can be a variable.
* Variables can be modified or overwritten by later code. It's not usually necessary to delete variables once they are no longer in use, the computer handles that.
* Plan ahead and try to name your variables well, names that are too short or generic will be more difficult to understand and follow when you review or modify your code later.
  * Use code comments too!

### [Python data types](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/02-Python/05-Data-Types.html)
* Single element data types:
  * Strings (Text)
  * Integers (Whole Numbers)
  * Floats (Decimal Numbers)
  * Booleans (True/False)

* Checking types
  * type()
* Converting between types
  * int(), str(), float()

* Multiple element data types (data structures):
  * Lists (an array of elements)
  * Dictionaries (a key-value structure)
  * (Less common, we won't cover these today)
    * Set (unordered, doesn't allow duplicates)
    * Tuple (ordered, not able to modify tuple contents)

* Addressing elements or ranges within lists or elements of dictionaries
  * list[0]
  * list[2:7]
  * dict["key"]

* Structures can be nested. For example, a list can contain elements that are themselves other lists.
  * list[0][2]

## Discuss questions and lessons learned (10 minutes)

**Share out either of the following:**
* One interesting thing you learned
* One question you have
* Any concerns or unclear topics?
