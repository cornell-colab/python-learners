# Session 2
Instructors:
* Iliana Burgos, Emerging Data Practices Librarian (itb23)
* Devin Sanera, Instructional Technology Coordinator (ds895)

## Welcome, review of previous session, and questions (15 minutes)

* Any questions from last time?
* Differences between VisualStudio, PyCharm, JupyterLab, VSCode
  * Differences between an IDE vs text editor, how the computer is processing your code
* Brief review of [Anatomy of a Python script](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/02-Python/03-Anatomy-Python-Script.html) and [Common Python errors](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/02-Python/13-Common-Python-Errors.html)

## Variables and Data Types (35 minutes)

### [Python variables](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/02-Python/04-Variables.html)
* A variable is a "container" for data. In Python, we create a new variable by assigning a value to it (other languages differ). If you've used a spreadsheet to run calculations, each cell can be a variable.
* Variables can be modified or overwritten by later code. It's not usually necessary to delete variables once they are no longer in use, the computer handles that.

### [Python data types](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/02-Python/05-Data-Types.html)
* Single element data types:
  * Strings (Text)
  * Integers (Whole Numbers)
  * Floats (Decimal Numbers)
  * Booleans (True/False)

* Checking types, converting between types

* Multiple element data types (data structures):
  * Lists (an array of elements)
  * Dictionaries (a key-value structure)

* Structures can be nested. For example, a list can contain elements that are themselves other lists.

## Discuss questions and lessons learned (10 minutes)

**Share out either of the following:**
* One interesting thing you learned
* One question you have
* Any concerns or unclear topics?
