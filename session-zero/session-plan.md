## Installing Python and Jupyter Lab (30 mins)
Follow instructions from [<i>Introduction to Cultural Analytics & Python</i> (Walsh, 2021)](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/welcome.html) to download Anaconda and Jupyter Lab onto your computer, and learn about Jupyter Notebooks:
* [Install Python and Jupyter Lab](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/02-Python/01-Install-Python.html)
* [How to Use Jupyter Notebooks](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/02-Python/02-How-to-Use-Jupyter-Notebooks.html)

## Optional: The Command Line

If you'd like to move beyond installing Python, check out [the Command Line](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/01-Command-Line/01-The-Command-Line.html) lesson. It provides a helpful foundation for learning how to communicate with your computer to open programs, access files, and consider file directories. This is especially important for learning how to access data files for analysis using Python.

## Discuss questions and lessons learned (10 minutes)
